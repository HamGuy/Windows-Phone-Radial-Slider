Radial Slider for Windows Phone
===========================

This is simply a radial slider control for Windows Phone developers. I'm still working on some of the features but the basic functionality is there and the control is fully usable in both WP7 and WP8 applications. I'm planning on updating the control to the point where all the current bugs and obscurities are fixed and the control is fully ready (and tested) for a production environment.
